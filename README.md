# Signal-Scouts
Built with a user-first approach, SignalTrail transforms the invisible world of network signals into a clear, navigable trail. Whether on a campus, hostel, office, or public space, users can follow Signal Trail's guidance to stay connected where it matters most.

# 📡 SignalTrail – Internet Strength Navigator

SignalTrail is a web-based solution that helps students find the **strongest Wi-Fi / internet signal** on campus, including hostels and academic areas.  
It guides users using a **direction arrow** and shows the **estimated distance** to reach the best internet spot.

## 🌐 What is the “Internet Signal” in SignalTrail?

SignalTrail works by:
- Checking available network signal strength near the user
- Comparing weak and strong connectivity zones
- Identifying the **best available internet signal location**
- Guiding the user toward that location

⚠️ Note: Browsers do not allow direct access to Wi-Fi router data, so SignalTrail uses:
- Device network strength indicators
- Location-based data
- Previously mapped signal strength points
to estimate the best internet area.
